# Automated-Academic-Scheduling-System-1-2-Project-
This model can be used to generate academic routines automatically by taking teachers, class, sections, subjects as inputs.
# Automated Class Routine Generation System (C)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **Automated Class Routine (Timetable) Generation System** developed using **C programming**.  
It simulates a real-world academic scheduling problem by managing classrooms, teachers, courses, and student sections, and automatically generates **conflict-free class routines** based on predefined constraints.

The project is designed following **structured programming principles** and is suitable for academic term projects and learning system-level problem solving in C.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate class routine generation
- Avoid scheduling conflicts
- Prioritize senior teachers
- Enforce classroom capacity and type constraints
- Store and retrieve data using files
- Export routines in printable formats

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Add and manage:
  - Teachers (name, seniority, workload, preferences)
  - Classrooms (capacity, type)
  - Courses (credits, duration, room type)
  - Sections (students, home classroom)
- Automatic timetable generation
- Conflict detection:
  - Teacher conflicts
  - Classroom conflicts
  - Section overlaps
  - Capacity violations
- Priority-based scheduling (senior teachers first)
- File handling for data persistence
- Export routine as:
  - Terminal table
  - CSV
  - HTML (printable)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- `struct` and array of structures
- Modular programming
- File handling (`fopen`, `fscanf`, `fprintf`)
- Sorting (teacher seniority)
- Time-slot based scheduling
- Constraint checking
- HTML & CSV generation from C
